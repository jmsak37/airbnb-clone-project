## UI/UX Design Planning 
 
### Design goals 
- Create an intuitive booking flow that minimizes steps and decisions for users. 
- Maintain visual consistency across pages and components. 
- Prioritize mobile-first responsive layouts. 
- Ensure accessibility and performance for all users. 
 
### Key features 
- Property search and advanced filtering (location, price, amenities). 
- High-quality listing galleries with lazy-loading and image placeholders. 
- Secure user authentication and account management. 
- Streamlined checkout and booking flow with clear confirmations. 
- Responsive UI components and reusable design system. 
 
| Page | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Property Listing View | Grid display of available properties with filters, sorting, and quick actions (favorite, view details). Responsive layout that adapts from mobile to desktop. | 
| Listing Detailed View | Detailed gallery, property description, amenities, host info, reviews, and an embedded booking form for selecting dates and guests. | 
| Simple Checkout View | Summary of booking, form for payment details and guest info, clear pricing breakdown and confirmation page with booking reference. | 
 
### Why user-friendly design matters 
User-friendly design reduces friction & increases conversion rates for bookings. Clear navigation, consistent visuals, and an accessible checkout flow reduce errors, support user trust, and lead to higher satisfaction and repeat bookings.

**Color styles** 
- Primary: #FF5A5F 
- Secondary: #008489 
- Background: #FFFFFF 
- Text: #222222 
- Secondary Text: #717171 
 
**Typography** 
- Primary font family: Circular 
- Weights: Book (400), Medium (500), Bold (700) 
- Body font size: 16px 
- Secondary text size: 14px 
- Headings: 24px - 32px (H1-H3 ranges) 
 
**Why identifying design properties matters** 
Identifying color styles and typography in a mockup ensures visual consistency, speeds up frontend implementation, and reduces rework. It helps developers create reusable components, makes CSS variables/theme tokens straightforward, and ensures accessibility checks (contrast, legibility) are applied uniformly. 
 
**UI/UX TODOs** 
- Confirm Figma tokens and export color palette. 
- Add Typography tokens and font files or font-stack fallback. 
- Create CSS variables or theme config for colors and type.
