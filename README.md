- Backend: Node.js or Django 
- Database: PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local dev) 
 
**Key features** 
- Property search and filtering 
- Listing detail view with images and booking form 
- User authentication (signup/login) 
 
**Figma/Design** 
- Primary color: #FF5A5F 
- Secondary color: #008489

## UI/UX Design Planning 
 
### Design goals 
- Create an intuitive booking flow that minimizes steps and decisions for users. 
- Maintain visual consistency across pages and components. 
- Prioritize mobile-first responsive layouts. 
- Ensure accessibility and performance for all users. 
 
### Key features 
- Property search and advanced filtering (location, price, amenities). 
- High-quality listing galleries with lazy-loading and image placeholders. 
- Secure user authentication and account management. 
- Streamlined checkout and booking flow with clear confirmations. 
- Responsive UI components and reusable design system. 
 
| Page | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Property Listing View | Grid display of available properties with filters, sorting, and quick actions (favorite, view details). Responsive layout that adapts from mobile to desktop. | 
| Listing Detailed View | Detailed gallery, property description, amenities, host info, reviews, and an embedded booking form for selecting dates and guests. | 
| Simple Checkout View | Summary of booking, form for payment details and guest info, clear pricing breakdown and confirmation page with booking reference. | 
 
### Why user-friendly design matters 
User-friendly design reduces friction & increases conversion rates for bookings. Clear navigation, consistent visuals, and an accessible checkout flow reduce errors, support user trust, and lead to higher satisfaction and repeat bookings.

### More UI/UX Design Planning 
 
**Color styles** 
- Primary: #FF5A5F 
- Secondary: #008489 
- Background: #FFFFFF 
- Text: #222222 
- Secondary Text: #717171 
 
**Typography** 
- Primary font family: Circular 
- Weights: Book (400), Medium (500), Bold (700) 
- Body font size: 16px 
- Secondary text size: 14px 
- Headings: 24px - 32px (H1-H3 ranges) 
 
**Why identifying design properties matters** 
Identifying color styles and typography in a mockup ensures visual consistency, speeds up frontend implementation, and reduces rework. It helps developers create reusable components, makes CSS variables/theme tokens straightforward, and ensures accessibility checks (contrast, legibility) are applied uniformly. 
 
**UI/UX TODOs** 
- Confirm Figma tokens and export color palette. 
- Add Typography tokens and font files or font-stack fallback. 
- Create CSS variables or theme config for colors and type. 
 
## Project Roles and Responsibilities 
 
Below are the core roles, their responsibilities, and how each contributes to the project success: 
 
- Project Manager: Oversees timeline, coordinates team communication, tracks milestones, and ensures deliverables meet scope and deadlines. 
- Frontend Developers: Build UI components, implement responsive layouts, integrate with backend APIs, and ensure cross-browser accessibility and performance. 
- Designers: Create mockups and prototypes in Figma, define color and typography tokens, and collaborate with frontend to ensure visual fidelity and UX quality. 
- QA/Testers: Define test cases, run manual and automated tests, report bugs, and verify fixes to ensure functionality and reliability. 
- DevOps Engineers: Configure CI/CD pipelines, manage hosting and deployment, monitor performance and uptime, and automate infrastructure provisioning. 
- Product Owner: Defines requirements and priorities, reviews deliverables for business alignment, and acts as stakeholder liaison. 
- Scrum Master: Facilitates agile ceremonies, removes blockers for the team, and helps maintain the sprint cadence. 
 
For each role, clear communication and shared documentation (issues, PRs, and a project board) are essential for project success. 
 
## UI Component Patterns 
 
We'll design reusable UI components to keep the interface consistent and speed up development: 
 
- Navbar: Site logo, search bar, user account menu, responsive hamburger menu for mobile. Should be accessible and keyboard navigable. 
 
- Property Card: Image thumbnail, title, location, price per night, rating, and favorite button. Designed to be used in grids and lists with responsive sizing. 
 
- Footer: Site links, contact info, social links, and legal text. Present on all pages and responsive. 
 
- Additional planned components: Listing gallery (carousel), Booking form (date picker, guests selector), Filters panel, Modal dialogs (login, booking confirmation), and Loader/Placeholder components. 
 
Each component will have props/variants for reuse across pages, and we will document props and usage in a components README or Storybook.
